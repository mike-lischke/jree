# Ported Types of java.io

This page lists the java.io types that are currently in this Node package. The notation describes the current status of a package or type. The symbol 🅵 means the type is fully converted (excluding functionality which cannot be implemented in Typescript, like synchronization), while Ⓟ indicates a partial conversion. Additionally, the symbol 𝑺 describes a type that is a stub, i.e. a type that is not yet implemented and exists solely to satisfy another type.
