# Ported Types of java.lang

This page lists the java.lang types that are currently in this Node package.

## Status Notation:
- ðŸ…µ means the type is fully converted (excluding functionality which cannot be implemented in Typescript, like synchronization).
- ðŸ…¿ indicates a partial conversion, which means that the type is not fully converted, but it is usable.
- ðŸ…‚ describes a type that is a stub, i.e. a type that is not yet implemented and exists solely to satisfy another type.
